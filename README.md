# Taxi-Tip-Prediction-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML
This project focuses on comparing the training speedup between Scikit-Learn and Snap ML for building a Decision Tree Regressor model. It also includes running inference using both models and evaluating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test dataset to assess their predictive performance.
